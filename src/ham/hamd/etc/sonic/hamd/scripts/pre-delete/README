# Before hamd deletes a user from /etc/passwd with the userdel command, hamd
# invokes, in ASCIIbetical order, the scripts found in this directory.
#
# Hamd invokes each script as follows:
#
#   [SCRIPT] [USER NAME]
#
# Examples:
#    SCRIPT wyatt
#
# Each SCRIPT should return 0 on success, and non-0 on failure. On failure,
# each SCRIPT should print the cause of the failure to the standard
# error (stderr).
